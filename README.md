# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Classifying whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign using Breast cancer wisconsin dataset with Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)

Data collected from UCI machine learning repository

Steps involved :

1) Load the Data

2) EDA

3) Train/Test split

4) Scaling

5) Creating a model with too many epochs and hence overfitting

6) Creating a model to get rid off that overfitting using EarlyStopping from Callbacks

7) Creating a model to get rid off overfitting using DropOut layers

8) Model Evaluation

** Visualizing the performance of network using Tensorboard

Callbacks records events for TensorBoard. Such as:

1) Metrics summarization

2) Training Phase Visualization

3) Activations Histograms

4) Sampled Profiling
